## üîë **Core Principles of Microservices Architecture**

### 1. **Single Responsibility (Business Capability per Service)**

Each microservice is designed around a **specific business function** (e.g., user, order, menu, payment, stock).

> üìå *One service = One purpose.*

---

### 2. **Independent Deployment**

Services are **deployed separately**, meaning you can update or scale one without affecting others.

> ‚úÖ Update Order Service without touching Menu or User Service.

---

### 3. **Decentralized Data Management**

Each service **owns its own database**, avoiding tight coupling and joins.

> ‚ùå No shared database
> ‚úÖ Each service manages its own data and schema.

---

### 4. **Communication via APIs**

Services talk to each other through **REST**, **gRPC**, or **event-driven messages** (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).

> üß© Loose coupling via HTTP or message queues.

---

### 5. **Scalability**

Services can be scaled **independently** based on their load.

> üß± Scale Order Service 10x during peak time, leave Menu Service as is.

---

### 6. **Fault Isolation**

If one service fails, the rest of the system can still function.

> üî• Order Service down ‚â† User Service down

---

### 7. **Technology Diversity**

Each microservice can use **different languages, databases, or frameworks**.

> Example:
>
> * User Service: Node.js + MongoDB
> * Order Service: Go + PostgreSQL

---

### 8. **Organized Around Business Domains**

Services reflect **business capabilities**, not technical layers.

> ‚úÖ OrderService, MenuService
> ‚ùå ControllerService, ModelService

## ‚úÖ Benefits

* Faster development and deployment
* Better maintainability and scalability
* Clear ownership per team or developer
* Easier CI/CD adoption

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges

* Complexity in communication
* Managing distributed transactions
* Need for centralized logging, tracing, and monitoring
* Testing becomes harder (integration tests especially)
